Timeline 0.4.0, released on 1 September 2009
============================================

This is a new feature release.

The first step in supporting additional data for events has been implemented.
The file format had to be changed for this. Files written by version 0.4.0 will
not be readable by previous versions, but 0.4.0 can read 0.3.0 files and will
convert them automatically.

New features, enhancements:

  * Translation support
  * Export to Image
  * Legend for categories
  * Longer descriptions for events (visualization will be implemented in 0.5.0)

New translations:

  * Swedish (Roger Lindberg)
  * Spanish (Roman Gelbort)
  * German (Nils Steinger)
  * Brazilian Portuguese (Leonardo Frigo da Purificação)

Timeline 0.3.0, released on 1 August 2009
=========================================

In this release the documentation has been improved and a few bugs have been
fixed.

The file format has also been updated to decrease the risk of loosing data.
Users are therefore strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version. The file
format is readable by the 0.2.0 version but it can not take advantage of the
new format.

New features, enhancements:

  * Changed to allow events without categories.
  * Improved what's displayed in the title bar (open file name first).
  * Added application icon.
  * Added Help menu.
  * Converted user manual to DocBook format.
  * Integrated user manual with application (first step).
  * Started experimenting with unit tests.
  * Added copyright notes to all source files.
  * Added AUTHORS, CHANGES, COPYING, and INSTALL.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed bug where application raised exceptions when scrolling to the very
    end or the very beginning of time (year 10 or year 9999).
  * If multiple timelines were opened, the displayed period would just be saved
    for the last opened one. That is fixed now so it is saved for all.

Timeline 0.2.0, released on 5 July 2009
=======================================

This version contains lots of improvements.

File format written by this version is not readable by previous versions.

New features, enhancements:

  * Added support for showing and hiding events from certain categories.
  * Added a week view in one zoom level of the timeline.
  * Added navigation functions such as 'Go to Date' and 'Go to Today'.
  * Improved controls for entering a date and time.

Timeline 0.1.0, released on 11 April 2009
