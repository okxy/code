<p>
This is the User's Guide for Timeline version 0.1.0.

</p>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Timeline is a cross-platform application for displaying and navigating
information on a timeline. With the application it is easy to quickly display
different periods in time with different kinds of information on the timeline.
</p>
<p>
The application is built with Python and uses wxPython as graphics library.
</p>
<p>
Here are some screenshots of Timeline showing different zoom levels.

We appreciate any feedback on this application.  Since this is the first
version, it only has basic functionality (but still should be useful) and we
are aware of that you may want more features. Our goal is to further develop
the application so suggestions for new functionality and features are welcome.

<h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
The basic idea is to display events on a timeline.  An event can be a single
point in time or span over a time period.  The user adds events to the
timeline. Events can also be removed or changed.
</p>
<h3 id="QuickStart">Quick Start</h3>
<p>

When the application is started, select <i>New</i> from the <i>File</i> menu and
enter a name of a file in the dialog box that opens. This is the name of the
file in which information about your events will be stored. Next time you start
the application you can choose to open the same file again.
</p>
<p>
When this is done, double click somewhere on the timeline. This will open a
dialog box in which you enter a name for an event. Click the <i>OK</i> button to
save the event. Now you will see a single point event above the middle of the
screen.
</p>
<p>
Next, hold the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down, click and drag the mouse to mark a time
period, and release the mouse button. Again the event dialog box will display
and you enter a name of the event and click <i>OK</i>. Now you will also see a
period event displayed under the middle of the screen.

</p>
<p>
Try the mouse wheel, and you will see the timeline scroll.
</p>
<p>
Try the mouse wheel while holding the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down and you will see the
timeline zoom.
</p>
<p>
The vertical red line indicates the current time.
</p>
<p>
Hoovering an event will display the full description in the status bar.
</p>
<h2 id="Topicsindetail">Topics in detail</h2>

<h3 id="Addingevents">Adding events</h3>
<p>
Adding events is done by opening the <i>Create Event</i> dialog.  When you have
filled in all the event properties in the dialog you click the <i>OK</i> button to
save the event in your event file.  If you change your mind about creating an
event you must click the <i>Close</i> button or press the <i>Esc</i> key.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Create Event</i> dialog can be opened in the following ways
</p>
<ul><li>Select the menu <i>File -&gt; Create Event</i>.
</li><li>Double click with the left mouse button on the timeline.
</li><li>Press the <i>Ctrl-key</i>, thereafter hold left mouse button down on the
timeline, drag the mouse and release it.
</li></ul><p>
The following properties can be defined for one event:

</p>
<dl><dt>Start</dt><dd>
This is the start time of the event and it must have the format
yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss.  This is a mandatory field and it must be less or
equal to the End time.
</dd><dt>End</dt><dd>
This is the time of the event ends and it must have the format
yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss.  This is a mandatory field and it must be greater or
equal to the Start time.
</dd><dt>Name</dt><dd>
A free text describing the event.
</dd><dt>Category</dt><dd>
If you have defined any categories (see chapter below) you can associate
the event with one of your categories.  An event can only belong to one
category.
</dd></dl>
<p>
Here is an example of how data entered in the dialog can look like:
</p>

<p>
<img src="CreateEventDialog.jpg" alt="Create Event Dialog" title="Create Event Dialog" />
   
</p>
<h3 id="Deletingevents">Deleting events</h3>
<p>
One or more events can be deleted at the same time. To delete events you first
select them and thereafter presses the <i>Delete</i> key.
</p>
<p>
Before the event is deleted the deletion must be acknowledged in the dialog box
that appears when the <i>Delete</i> key is pressed.

</p>
<p>
An event is selected by clicking within the rectangle representing the event.
The event is deselected by clicking on it once again.  To select more than one
event, hold the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down while selecting events.
</p>
<h3 id="Editcategories">Edit categories</h3>
<p>
Categories are used to group events.  An event can belong to one and only one
category.  All events that belong to the same category are displayed with the
same background color.  The color to be used is defined by the category.
</p>
<p>
If you want to edit the categories you open the <i>Edit Categories</i> dialog.
This is done by Select the menu <i>Timeline -&gt; Edit Categories</i>.  The dialog
looks like this:

</p>
<p>
<img src="EditCategoriesDialog.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
You create a new category by clicking the <i>Add</i> button and thereafter filling
in the attributes of the category in the dialog that appears.
</p>
<p>
<img src="EditCategoryDialog.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
You delete a category by selecting it in the listbox and clicking the
<i>Delete</i> button.  You thereafter have to acknowledge the delete in the dialog
that appears.  When you delete a category, all the events that belonged to this
category are associated with the special category None.
