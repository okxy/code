<h1 id="TimelineUserManual">Timeline User Manual</h1>
<p>
This page describes how to use Timeline versions 0.2.x. It assumes that you
have already installed it. 
</p>
<p>
The tutorial should contain enough information to get you started using
Timeline. Later you can come back and read more details about particular
features.
</p>
<h2 id="Tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>
The idea is to display events on a timeline and to be able to quickly change
what period in time is shown. An event can be at a specific point in time or
span over a period.
</p>
<p>
<img src="events.png" />
<br />
<i>Showing the two different types of events (cursor hoovering blue event).</i>
</p>
<p>
<img src="zoom.png" />
<br />
<i>Showing the same timeline as above but with a different zoom level.</i>
</p>
<p>
To create a new timeline, select <i>New</i> from the <i>File</i> menu and
enter a name of a file in the dialog box that opens. This is the name of the
file in which information about your events will be stored. Next time you start
Timeline you can choose to open the same file again.
</p>
<p>
To add a new event at a specific point in time, double click somewhere on the
timeline. This will open a dialog box in which you enter a text for the event.
Click the <i>OK</i> button to save the event. Now you will see an event above the
horizontal line at the specific point in time that you double clicked on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Timeline automatically saves all changes for you so you never need to
manually save your timeline.</strong>
</p>
<p>
To add an event that spans over a period, hold the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down, click and
drag the mouse to mark a period, and release the mouse button. Again the event
dialog box will display and you enter a text for the event and click <i>OK</i>.
Now you will also see an event displayed under the horizontal line spanning
over the period that you selected.
</p>
<p>
Events at a specific point in time will always be displayed above the
horizontal line. Events spanning over a period period will be displayed below
the horizontal line most of the time.  However, if the period is to small to
fit within a few pixels on the screen, it will be displayed above the
horizontal line (zooming in will make the event jump from above to below).
</p>
<p>
To edit an event, double click on it and the event dialog box will appear.
</p>
<p>
To select an event, just click on it. To select multiple events, hold down the
<i>Ctrl-key</i> while selecting events. To delete the selected events, press the
<i>Del-key</i>.
</p>
<p>
Try the mouse wheel and you will see the timeline scroll.
</p>
<p>
Try pressing the left mouse button and drag and you will see the timeline
scroll.
</p>
<p>
Try the mouse wheel while holding the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down and you will see the
timeline zoom.
</p>
<p>
The vertical red line indicates the current time.
</p>
<p>
Hoovering an event will display the full description in the status bar.
</p>
<h2 id="TopicsinDetail">Topics in Detail</h2>
<h3 id="EditingEvents">Editing Events</h3>
<p>
Editing event information is done in the dialog shown below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="event_editor.png" />
</p>
<p>
It is used both for creating new events and for editing existing ones.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Create Event</i> dialog can be opened in the following ways:
</p>
<ul><li>Select the menu <i>File -&gt; Create Event</i>.
</li><li>Double click with the left mouse button on the timeline.
</li><li>Press the <i>Ctrl-key</i>, thereafter hold left mouse button down on the
timeline, drag the mouse and release it.
</li></ul><p>
The <i>Edit Event</i> dialog can be opened by double clicking on an event.
</p>
<p>
The following properties can be defined for an event:
</p>
<dl><dt>Start</dt><dd>
This is the start time of the event if it spans a period, otherwise it is
the specific point in time. If used for a period, it has to be less or
equal to the end time.
</dd><dt>End</dt><dd>
This is the end time of the event if it spans a period. This is not used
otherwise. If used it has to be greater or equal to the start time.
</dd><dt>Text</dt><dd>
A free text describing the event.
</dd><dt>Category</dt><dd>
If you have defined any categories (see section below) you can associate
the event with one of your categories. An event can only belong to one
category.
</dd></dl>
<p>
The checkboxes at the top of the dialog work as following:
</p>
<dl><dt>Period</dt><dd>
If checked, both the start and end time will be used to define the
period that the event spans. If unchecked only the start time will be
enabled and it will specify the specific point in time for the event.
</dd><dt>Show time</dt><dd>
If checked, you can specify a time for the start and end time in addition
to the date. This is useful if you are editing events on a day level where
the time is also important. The time will default to 00:00 if not entered.
</dd><dt>Close on OK</dt><dd>
If checked, the dialog will close when you click OK. Otherwise it will not.
This can be used to add multiple events without closing the dialog.
</dd></dl>
<h3 id="DeletingEvents">Deleting Events</h3>
<p>
One or more events can be deleted at the same time. To delete events you first
select them and thereafter press the <i>Delete</i> key.
</p>
<p>
Before the event is deleted the deletion must be acknowledged in the dialog box
that appears when the <i>Delete</i> key has been pressed.
</p>
<p>
An event is selected by clicking within the rectangle representing the event.
The event is deselected by clicking on it once again. To select more than one
event, hold the <i>Ctrl-key</i> down while selecting events.
</p>
<h3 id="Categories">Categories</h3>
<p>
Categories are used to group events. An event can belong to one and only one
category. All events that belong to the same category are displayed with the
same background color. The color to be used is defined by the category. You can
also choose to show or hide all events belonging to a category.
</p>
<p>
If no categories exist (as is the case when a new timeline is created) no
categories will be associated with events. But as soon as there is a category
an event must have one. (This might change in future versions so that you can
create events without associating a category to it. Or maybe associate a
default category.)
</p>
<p>
If you want to edit the categories you open the <i>Edit Categories</i> dialog.
This is done by selecting the menu <i>Timeline -&gt; Edit Categories</i>.  The dialog
looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="edit_categories.png" />
</p>
<p>
You create a new category by clicking the <i>Add</i> button and thereafter filling
in the attributes of the category in the dialog that appears. The visible
checkbox determines if the events belonging to that category should be visible
or not. This flag can also be modified in the sidebar (<i>View -&gt; Sidebar</i>).
</p>
<p>
<img src="edit_category.png" />
<br />
<i>The Edit Category dialog.</i>
</p>
<p>
<img src="sidebar.png" />
<br />
<i>Showing the correspondence between the visible flag in the Edit Category
dialog and the sidebar.</i>
</p>
<p>
You delete a category by selecting it in the listbox and clicking the
<i>Delete</i> button.  You thereafter have to acknowledge the delete in the dialog
that appears.  When you delete a category, all the events that belonged to this
category are associated with the special category None.
</p>
<p>
To edit a category, just double click on it.
</p>
<h3 id="NavigationFunctions">Navigation Functions</h3>
<p>
In addition to the basic navigation functions described in the tutorial there
are also a set of navigation functions in the <i>Navigate</i> menu:
</p>
<ul><li>Go To Today
</li><li>Go To Date...
</li><li>Fit Year
</li><li>Fit Month
</li><li>Fit Day
</li></ul><p>
<i>Go To Today</i> scrolls the timeline until the current date is at the center of
the screen.
</p>
<p>
<i>Go To Date</i> has the same functionality as <i>Go To Today</i> with the exception
that the user selects the date in a dialog.
</p>
<p>
<img src="goto_date.png" />
<br />
<i>The Go to Date dialog.</i>
</p>
<p>
The <i>Show Time</i> checkbox is used to enable or disable input of time. The time
will default to 00:00 if not entered. The timeline will be centered at the date
and time.  When the dialog is opened it is the date and time at the center
of the screen that is displayed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fit Year</i> will expand or contract the timeline so that it shows one whole
year. The year shown is the year that is in the center of the screen.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fit Month</i> and <i>Fit Day</i> has the same functionality as the <i>Fit Year</i>
except that the timeline will display one single month and one single day.
